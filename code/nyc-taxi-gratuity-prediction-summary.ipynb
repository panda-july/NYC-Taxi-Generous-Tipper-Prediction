    "    * Vendor was an important feature to predict whether a passenger will tip >=20% or not. However it may due to tip amount calculation difference, not associated with passengers.\n",
    "    * When consider tip amount calculation difference, lack of important features, model performance was not good\n",
    "* To get more reliable prediction result, could consider collect more features such as passenger actual tip choice, passenger group(e.g. age, income, why they take a taxi, actual passenger count, do they have luggage or bags, relationship of passengers, region, job), taxi info(e.g. accessible taxi or not, vehicle type, how old the vehicle, payment system Vendor, how many hours vehicle used per day, how often the vehicle will be cleaned), driver info(e.g. age, region, income, driving experience, full time/part time, information about breaking traffic laws, how long they drive per day, rent car/owner, work period(06:00-18:00)), cash tip data.\n",
